    <h3 class="cover-heading red-text">Abstract</h3>
    <p>Economic development research heavily relies on limited, expensive and sometimes “doubtful” survey data. Processing (free) readily available NASA satellite imagery is one solution to the problem. This talk will highlight some of those benefits and walk through a step-by-step technical example.</p>

    <h3 class="cover-heading red-text">Description</h3>
    <p>Economists around the world often rely on limited survey data to conduct research in their respective fields. The surveys, whether produced locally or by an international entity, are not only quite expensive but also limited.
(1) Timeframe and frequency. Surveys might (if we are lucky) be conducted every year. But often times the gap is more likely closer to every 5 years.
(2) Geographically too. Data pertaining to remote or “sensitive” regions might never get recorded.
(3) Accuracy and trustworthiness. Some data can be (explicitly or accidently) unreliable and erroneous. 
The aim from this talk is to not only highlight some of the benefits of Alternative Data but also break down some of the technical barriers to entry. I will specifically walk through a use case that utilizes NASA’s (free!) Nightlight Satellite Imagery. (All possible from within a local machine.)</p>

    <p>Mariem&#39;s background is in computer science and engineering. She started her career as a software developer. She later discovered a passion for data science. At Credit Suisse, Mariem works on various data sets and her projects touch upon BI, text mining, automation, sentiment analysis and recommendation systems. In addition to her day-to-day role, Mariem has a strong interest in tech for social good; she at times volunteers at hackathons for non-profits. Mariem is also an advocate for getting more people into technology: she has previously created and taught Python and web programming workshops; she has also been featured in the book, &#34;Her STEM Career: Adventures of 51 Remarkable Women&#34;, aimed at introducing young girls to various STEM fields.</p>
