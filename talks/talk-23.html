    <h2 style="text-align: center">Abstract</h2>
    <p>The Generative age gives us a new canvas for creativity, which we have only just started to explore. The talk covers one such use case of AI to switch between the modalities (or senses that we humans have) - mapping colours with musical notes, allowing the artwork to speak for itself and much more.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Description</h2>
    <p>We humans are the masterpieces. We are born with awesome capabilities and applaudable talents making us different from one another. As an individual , nobody thinks the way others do , they have their own intriguing ways to look at this world. Few of us have this exceptional quality to be able to visualise sounds and map colours with the words. It is termed as Synesthesia. It is fascinating to know how human brain can see sounds and hear colours, how it thinks of a word, and sees blocks of colours, and then these blocks get translated into letters. There are few who see the letters with a halo-effect. The letters give- off almost a glow of a certain colour.It is a striking fact that the synesthetic brains are wired a little differently from the ones of non-synesthetes. 
This talk will cover the unexplored applications of python programming by harnessing simple mathematical techniques to simulate the synesthetic ( bridging modalities) behaviour of brain.It is really appealing to be able to look at the world wearing colourful shades and building an AI that would help us doing the same is truly astounding. The talk covers an interesting viewpoint on how python can be used widely to analyse some of the really complex human brain behaviours ,in addition to solving comparatively trivial real world problems.</p>

    <p>Aakanksha is a sophomore at SRM University AP ,Amaravati, India , majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. She likes learning new skills and applying those to solve the problems that the society faces ,this being one of the several reasons of her keen interest in Artificial Intelligence ,hence contributing to the idea of giving back to community. 
She uses python for Machine Learning , Deep Learning and Image Processing , to come up with  hacks that explore the numerous applications of AI and their uses to make society a better place.  Apart from obsessing over the optimization of a model, she reads , a lot - it could be anything like - The Virgin Way by Richard Branson, Thiel’s Zero to One or Michelle Obama’s Becoming. She is a  vocalist and loves listening to Beatles and Adele.</p>
