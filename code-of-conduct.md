PyLondinium
------------------

PyLondinium is a conference intended for enjoying the Python language, networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, sponsors, organisers and volunteers at the event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers  will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to ensure an enjoyable experience and a safe environment for everybody.

Code of conduct
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyLondinium.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a personâ€™s ability to participate within them.

- Pablo Galindo at +447895826798

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

Incident response guidelines
------------------------------------------
Should you observe or experience behaviour that is disrupting to the friendly environment of the event then please get into contact with our support team about it. In some cases this may even make sense for seemingly minor incidents if the observed behaviour may become harassing through frequent repetition.

If an ongoing conflict is observed then please consult with the support team immediately and try to separate the involved parties if possible (if police intervention is in order do not hesitate to call them directly). The support team will try to reinstate the peace and investigate the incident afterwards by taking reports from everyone involved and observing third parties.

The support team and organisers shall assist any party who wants to press charges by notifying and guiding them to the relevant authorities. The support team should offer further assistance to all parties (e.g. by contacting a friend, arranging an escort) to help them deal with the aftermath of an incident.

Enforcement actions will usually only be taken be taken by the organisers once a written report is submitted by the support team. Any person at the receiving end of such action shall be given a chance to dispute the claims against them. Failure to cooperate with the organisers will result in immediate actions and may also result in further actions including criminal charges if applicable.
