I love Python and I love SQL. I wrote the library SQLpy to bring the two together in glorious harmony!\r\n\r\nBefore 9fin, I worked in Investment Banking Technology for 4 years. On teams building trading, risk monitoring and liquidity management systems. The common theme in all my different roles was working with SQL and databases every day.

I'm not so great with the different joins types.\r\n(awkward pause)\r\nteammate: But sure let's see what we can do, and let's check Stack Overflow\r\n\r\nThus goes the (unfair) perception of application developers and SQL. It may be true that application developers know less of the vast Swiss-Army knife like capabilities of SQL, but quite frankly the need has not been that pressing. So many amazing tools exist to abstract the data persistence layer away into Python native object oriented patterns. Even self-declared SQLers use these tools to great effect. Letting us all focus on application related problems. ORMs and the like take care of moving things into and out of storage for us.\r\n\r\nBut what if you want to do some wild pre-computed sub-partitions of your data first, or you want to work with json data, or you want to do something that the ORM does not support yet, but the underlying database does? Sometimes, you just want some data out, as values, in your Python code. Especially with the explosion of Python being used in Data Science and Machine Learning activities, where the shape of your data is always changing, rigid object based data mapping makes it hard to move quickly, prototype and iterate.\r\n\r\n# So what?\r\nI hope to show you that you probably know more SQL than you think, and that it's really simple to interface directly with a relational database system through Python. Unlocking the latest features of your database, allowing you to do more in the database layer therefore alleviating some load on your Python code, and putting a lot of the data decisions back into your hands.

A lot of logic was in procedures, and there were *many* scripts pulling reports out and logging metrics everywhere.

With a lot of DBs being treated as dumb stores of data only, interfacing with data-stores has been ceded to Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) and that's that.

All written in python using a simple text editor without the need for any special software, drivers or soldering.\r\n\r\nThe globe has a rainbow mode that randomly fades different colors in and out and an alarm mode to detect intruders. Modes can be switched by giving the globe a tap which it detects with it\u2019s motion sensors. Once in alarm mode the globe will flash green until an intruder steps on the conductive thread which will sound the alarm and flash the globe red.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Playground was used to teach my six year old daughter the differences between computer inputs and outputs and how to issue commands to computers using the Python REPL. She learned about the different frequencies of sound waves by calling the beep function with different frequencies. This opened up the topic of the hearing range of humans compared to other animals like dogs. She then learned to set the color of each of the ten NeoPixel LEDs into a rainbow pattern by calling the light function multiple times with each color and position. We explored how any color can be displayed as a combination of red, green and blue by using a digital microscope to see these three LEDs change with different colors. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover:\r\n\r\n1.

As such, deep learning models are notoriously tricky to optimally tune, where thorough exploration of architectures and hyperparameters is imperative.\r\n\r\nGrid search and randomized search methodologies are traditionally used to tune model hyperparameters, however they are costly approaches and incorporate no notion of how trials of previous hyperparameters have performed.
