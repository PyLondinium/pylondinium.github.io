        "description": "After the success of last year, Trans\\*Code returns to PyLondinium 2019. Trans\\*Code is the UKâ€™s only hack event series focused solely on drawing attention to transgender issues and opportunities.\n\nOpen to trans and non-binary folk and allies -- coders, designers and visionaries of all sorts -- Trans\\*Code is inspired by the groundbreaking Trans\\*H4CK events created by Dr. Kortney Ziegler. The event aims to help draw attention to transgender issues through a topic-focused hackday. Community members not currently working in technology are also encouraged to participate.\n\nCo-organiser Naomi Ceder explains: \"As technology offers growing opportunities, being sure these opportunities are equally accessible to traditionally marginalised groups grows ever more important.\"If you have an idea, can code, can design, want to learn, or want to improve the situation of the trans and non-binary communities through technology, please join us.",
