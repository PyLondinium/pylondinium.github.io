		"description": "Home-Assistant is an open-source, Python 3, home automation hub, typically running on a Raspberry Pi in the home. Home-Assistant can connect with with a huge range of sensors, switches and services, and the state of the system is continually logged to an SQL database on the hub. This combination of open-source software using standard tools, and broad integration with services and hardware makes Home-Assistant an ideal platform for conducting citizen data science projects.\r\n\r\nThis talk will begin with an introduction to Home-Assistant and highlight the features which make it ideal as a data backend for citizen science projects. The talk then presents a project on personalised air quality monitoring. This project uses a battery-powered\u00a0[low cost sensor](https://www.hackster.io/OxygenLithium/particulater-air-quality-monitoring-for-everyone-3caef2) to monitor air quality as well as other environmental variables. Sensor readings along with GPS data are transmitted back to Home-Assistant, and logged to the database. Home-Assistant allows a user to monitor, visualise and ultimately predict their daily exposure to pollution. Home-Assistant automations can then be used to trigger actions based on the data. For example flashing a red light in the users home when it predicts they may become exposed to a higher than average level of pollution. In the talk Q&A it is anticipated that the audience will raise their own challenges in their citizen science projects and together we can explore solutions using Home-Assistant.",

Trying to understand why it's so slow\r\nteammate: Woah, hold on there.... I'm not so great with the different joins types.\r\n(awkward pause)\r\nteammate: But sure let's see what we can do, and let's check Stack Overflow\r\n\r\nThus goes the (unfair) perception of application developers and SQL. It may be true that application developers know less of the vast Swiss-Army knife like capabilities of SQL, but quite frankly the need has not been that pressing. So many amazing tools exist to abstract the data persistence layer away into Python native object oriented patterns. Even self-declared SQLers use these tools to great effect. Letting us all focus on application related problems. ORMs and the like take care of moving things into and out of storage for us.\r\n\r\nBut what if you want to do some wild pre-computed sub-partitions of your data first, or you want to work with json data, or you want to do something that the ORM does not support yet, but the underlying database does? Sometimes, you just want some data out, as values, in your Python code. Especially with the explosion of Python being used in Data Science and Machine Learning activities, where the shape of your data is always changing, rigid object based data mapping makes it hard to move quickly, prototype and iterate.\r\n\r\n# So what?\r\nI hope to show you that you probably know more SQL than you think, and that it's really simple to interface directly with a relational database system through Python. Unlocking the latest features of your database, allowing you to do more in the database layer therefore alleviating some load on your Python code, and putting a lot of the data decisions back into your hands. Plus how a helping hand from tools such as SQLpy can let you do this in a Pythonic and *sane* way.",

It was created by the Physicist Damien P. George in 2013.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on how MicroPython is used in product development for industrial applications.  Besides two products that use MicroPython for their System Architecture, it shows how Product Certification was made easier, why MicroPython was preferred instead of using a traditional Operating System for the embedded system and why Embedded Software Developers choose MicroPython instead of C/C++.\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n* What is MicroPython?\r\n* Low Power & Low Footprint\r\n* Benefit of Scripting Languages in embedded systems\r\n* Mixing code! Assembler, C or MicroPython?\r\n* MicroPython cuts Product Development Process into half\r\n* MIT license\r\n* MicroPython used in real-world applications \u2013 examples\r\n* Demonstration\r\n* Questions",

		"title": "Can you boost your acceptance tests?",
		"description": "#What is the main topic of your talk?\r\nThe main topic is software testing. The talk will present two popular python test-frameworks in combination: RobotFramework and Hypothesis. If you want to write code to mimic the actions of a user, Robot is a good choice. But, you can use Robot with Hypothesis to convert static examples into much more comprehensive tests. Hypothesis provides a way to produce test inputs by describing rules to generate test inputs. We can combine Hypothesis and Robot to produce tests that could - in theory - replicate all the describable uses your system.\r\n\r\n#Who is this talk targetting?\r\nThis talk will be most impactful for software testing functions. The topic isn't difficult to understand, and when you hear about it, you'll wonder why we haven't always been doing this. The approach falls within Test Driven Development and a particular sub-field, Behaviour Driven Development. Property-based testing helps to catch bugs that you wouldn't think to test. Or, at least, it speeds up the process of catching these bugs because it takes some of the burdent of producing interesting test examples from the developer. \r\n\r\n#Why will the talk be interesting for the audience?\r\nBugs are beneficial! The talk motivates for a better approach to software development. It's time to stop blaming developers for bugs and to adopt a positive attitude towards bugs. I'll explain why and I'll show you a technique for combining more exhaustive test data with tests that mimic a user of your system. ",

		"name": "Niall Turbitt",
		"title": "Tuning the knobs of neural networks using Bayesian Optimization",
		"description": "Choosing the best hyperparameters for machine learning models is sometimes considered as more of an art than science. For most machine learning practitioners, mastering this art of tuning hyperparameters requires not only a competent background in machine learning algorithms, but also extensive experience working with real-world datasets. Most machine learning algorithms present a variety of hyperparameters to tune, and in the case of neural networks and deep learning models, the list of potential hyperparameters to adjust can increase exponentially. As such, deep learning models are notoriously tricky to optimally tune, where thorough exploration of architectures and hyperparameters is imperative.\r\n\r\nGrid search and randomized search methodologies are traditionally used to tune model hyperparameters, however they are costly approaches and incorporate no notion of how trials of previous hyperparameters have performed. Bayesian Optimization is one such approach that forms knowledge about the relation between the hyperparameter settings and model performance in order to make a smarter choice for future parameter settings. \r\n\r\nUsing Zalando\u2019s Fashion MNIST dataset, which comprises of 60,000 clothing images, I present the use of Bayesian Optimization to tune the hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network in Keras.",

Attendees will learn how to construct a general relativity raytracer to produce black hole images as seen in the Interestelar (2014) movie, how to start from a pure python solution, understanding the bottlenecks and why vanilla python is not very well suited for this kind of calculations and how to evolve this solution step by step into more performant code using the tools already available in the python ecosystem understanding the pros, cons and what are the best scenarios to use each one of these.
